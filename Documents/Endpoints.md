Proposed Backend API EndpointsThis list outlines the core RESTful API endpoints the backend should provide to the frontend, based on the PRD (nba_stats_prd_user_stories_v1).(Base URL might be /api/v1/ or similar)GET /statusPurpose: Get the data update timestamps for the navigation bar.Response: { "last_update": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ", "next_update": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" }GET /teamsPurpose: Get a list of all teams for the current season.Response: [ { "team_id": ..., "name": "...", "abbreviation": "...", "logo_url": "..." }, ... ]GET /teams/{team_id}Purpose: Get detailed information for a specific team, including roster, full schedule, stats, and SoS.Response: { "team_id": ..., "name": "...", ..., "roster": [ { "player_id": ..., "full_name": ... }, ... ], "schedule": [ { "game_id": ..., "opponent_id": ..., "date_utc": ..., "status": ..., "score": "..." }, ... ], "stats": { ... }, "sos": { "played": ..., "remaining": ... } }GET /playersPurpose: Get a list of all players for the current season (potentially with pagination/filtering).Query Params (Optional): ?filter_team={team_id}, ?filter_position={pos}, ?page=1Response: [ { "player_id": ..., "full_name": "...", "current_team_id": ..., "position": "...", "headshot_url": "..." }, ... ]GET /players/{player_id}Purpose: Get detailed information for a specific player, including bio, season averages, and full game log.Response: { "player_id": ..., "full_name": "...", ..., "season_averages": { "pts": ..., "reb": ..., ... }, "game_log": [ { "game_id": ..., "date_utc": ..., "opponent_id": ..., "stats": { "pts": ..., ... } }, ... ] }GET /players/{player_id}/last_x_games?count={5|10|20}Purpose: Get aggregated stats for the player's last 5, 10, or 20 games played.Response: { "games_analyzed": ..., "stats": { "avg_pts": ..., "avg_reb": ..., ... } }GET /players/{player_id}/high_low_games?count=5Purpose: Get the player's top 5 and bottom 5 scoring games for the season.Response: { "top_5": [ { "game_id": ..., "date_utc": ..., "pts": ... }, ... ], "bottom_5": [ { "game_id": ..., "date_utc": ..., "pts": ... }, ... ] }GET /games/upcomingPurpose: Get a list of upcoming games.Response: [ { "game_id": ..., "game_date_utc": ..., "home_team": { "id": ..., "name": ..., "logo_url": ... }, "away_team": { "id": ..., "name": ..., "logo_url": ... } }, ... ]GET /games/{game_id}/previewPurpose: Get preview information for an upcoming game (lineups, head-to-head).Response: { "game_id": ..., "game_date_utc": ..., "home_team": { ... }, "away_team": { ... }, "head_to_head_current_season": [ { "game_id": ..., "date": ..., "score": ... } ], "lineups": { "home": [ { "player_id": ..., "full_name": ... } ], "away": [ ... ] } }GET /games/{game_id}/detailsPurpose: Get detailed box score information for a completed game.Response: { "game_id": ..., "game_date_utc": ..., "status": "Completed", "home_team": { ... }, "away_team": { ... }, "box_score": { "home": [ { "player_id": ..., "full_name": ..., "stats": { "min": ..., "pts": ..., ... } }, ... ], "away": [ ... ] } }GET /search?term={search_query}Purpose: Search for teams and players matching the query term.Response: [ { "team": { "team_id": ..., "name": ..., "logo_url": ... }, "players": [ { "player_id": ..., "full_name": ..., "is_traded_flag": true/false }, ... ] }, ... ] (Structure as defined in PRD Section 3)Notes:Error handling (e.g., 404 Not Found for invalid IDs) should be implemented.Authentication is likely not needed for this personal project, but could be added if required.Consider adding pagination to endpoints returning lists (/teams, /players, /games/upcoming) if performance becomes an issue.The exact structure of the JSON responses can be refined, but this provides a clear intent for each endpoint.
